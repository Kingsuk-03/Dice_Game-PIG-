__Pig dice is a popular dice game that can be played with two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, typically 100.__

__Here are the basic rules of the Pig dice game : __

__Gameplay:__ The game is played in turns, with each player taking a turn in clockwise order.

__Turn Structure:__ On your turn, you roll the die and accumulate points based on the outcome. The following rules apply:

a. If you roll a 1, you lose all points earned in that turn, and your turn ends. It is now the next player's turn.

b. If you roll a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, you can choose to either:

Roll again and add the rolled number to your turn score, or
End your turn and add your accumulated turn score to your total score.
c. You can continue rolling the die as long as you choose to and keep accumulating points in your turn, but remember that if you roll a 1, you lose all the points earned in that turn.

__Scoring:__ The points you accumulate during your turn are added to your turn score. If you choose to end your turn, your turn score is added to your total score. The first player to reach or exceed the target score (e.g., 100) wins the game.
